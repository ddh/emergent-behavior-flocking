1. (OPtional) find a sprite sheet you like.
2. Use Alfred Sprite unpacker to individually select which sprites you'd like to keep
	- This exports each picked sprite as an individual png file
3. Then use photoshop to open each of these png files into their own layers:
	- DO this by using File>Script>Load stack
4. Adjust each layer for alignment, and make any other tweaks
5. Use the script found on the tutorial: http://www.williammalone.com/articles/html5-animation-sprite-sheet-photoshop/
	- File>Script>Create SPrite SHeet From Layers
6. Save the resulting png sprite sheet
